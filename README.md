## Installation

Download the `.mltbx` file from the [GitHub repository releases area](https://github.com/eddins/imzm/releases/) or from the [File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/167316-image-zoom-level-and-pan-utilities). Double-click on the downloaded file to automatically and run the MATLAB add-on installer. This will copy the files to your MATLAB add-ons area and add `imzm` to your MATLAB search path.

Later, you can use the [MATLAB Add-On Manager](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html) to uninstall.
